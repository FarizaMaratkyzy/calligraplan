Basics
------

planconvert converts some project file formats into Calligra Plan file format.
It is written in Java and uses MPXJ for reading other file formats, see:
https://www.mpxj.org

This means that planconvert *should* be able to convert from all the file formats MPXJ supports.
However, so far only Planner (*.planner) and MS project file formats *.mpx and *.mpp has been tested.

Schema classes are generated from the plan-<version>.dtd file.
See property 'plan.dtd.dir' in build.xml.

Everything is done using 'ant' and the different jobs are defined in build.xml.

Making changes
--------------

1) New mpxj version:
    a) In build.xml: Change property 'mpxj.version' to the new version.
    b) Execute: 'ant get-mpxj'
       This will download and unsip mpxj into 'mpxj.dir'.

2) New plan dtd version:
    a) In build.xml: Change property 'plan.version' to the new version
    b) If mpxj is not present, execute 'ant get-mpxj'
    c) Execute: 'ant xjc'
       This will create new schema classes.
    d) Update PlanWriter to deal with changes
    e) Execute 'ant jar'
    f) Commit when everything works ;)

Regenerate everything
---------------------
Execute: 'ant all'

Running
-------
Execute: 'ant run'
