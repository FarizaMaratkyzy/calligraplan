Some useful stuff:              
You can search the source code for FIXME and TODO entries with:
find . -name "*.c*" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -E "(###|TODO|FIXME|todo)"

Using -A and -B with grep gives you some additional context around the particular comment:
find . -name "*.c*" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -A 3 -B 3 -E "(###|TODO|FIXME|todo)"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In no particular order or priority:


* Improving printing of gantt chart:
	Proper task list
	Selected tasks

* Improving reports, it's very rudimentary
	Maybe drag-n-drop into Words?

* Import task data from spreadsheet (User request)

* Improve the graphical dependency editor:
    It is difficult to use when there are many tasks/dependencies.
    Collapse/expand summary tasks
    'Tree' indication to better indicate which subtasks belongs to which summary task
    Info view/docker to (optionally) show more information

* Add a 'calendar' view for the resources (ala korganizer) to show appointments

* Add filter / sort to (some) views

* Improve gantt chart
	When selected in list, show selection in chart and vs (?)
	Position correctly on start/end datetime (small offset now)

* Add time period config to cost breakdown view


* Fix d-n-d of vcards from kontact into resources

* Sql Database storage

* Improve planwork, possibly coupled to sql database storage
