Some useful stuff:              
You can search the source code for FIXME and TODO entries with:
find . -name "*.c*" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -E "(###|TODO|FIXME|todo)"

Using -A and -B with grep gives you some additional context around the particular comment:
find . -name "*.c*" -o -name "*.h" | xargs grep -A 3 -B 3 -E "(###|TODO|FIXME|todo)"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In no particular order or priority:


* Improving printing of gantt chart:
	Proper task list
	Selected tasks
	Limited by dates

* Adding printing to performance charts (and to the rest of the missing views)

* Improving reports, it's very rudimentary
	Maybe drag-n-drop into Words?

* Import task data from spreadsheet (User request)

* Improve the graphical dependency editor:
    It is difficult to use when there are many tasks/dependencies.
    Collapse/expand summary tasks
    'Tree' indication to better indicate which subtasks belongs to which summary task
    Info view/docker to (optionally) show more information

* Add a 'calendar' view for the resources (ala korganizer) to show appointments

* Add possibility to automatically schedule after changes to the project.

* Add filter / sort to (some) views

* Improve gantt chart
	Time now
	Context menu on tasks in chart
	When selected in list, show selection in chart and vs (?)
	Remove the position diffrence of items in list and chart
	Position correctly on start/end datetime (small offset now)

* Add time period config to cost breakdown view


* Fix d-n-d of vcards from kontact into resources

* Sql Database storage

* Improve planwork, possibly coupled to sql database storage
